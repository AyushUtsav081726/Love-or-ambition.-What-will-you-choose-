# Love-or-ambition.-What-will-you-choose-


In the quiet of the night, under moonlit skies,

A question lingers in the air, with tears in our eyes.

Love and ambition, they both call our name,

But choosing between them, feels like playing a game.


What will you choose, when the world's in your hand?

Love's tender embrace or ambitions so grand?

In the depths of your heart, where your dreams take a stand,

What will you choose, love or ambition's demand?


Love's a gentle whisper, a comforting embrace,

It fills our souls with warmth, puts a smile on our face.

But ambition's a fire, burning deep within,

It pushes us to strive, to reach for the win.


What will you choose, when the world's in your hand?

Love's tender embrace or ambitions so grand?

In the depths of your heart, where your dreams take a stand,

What will you choose, love or ambition's demand?


In the tapestry of life, we search for a thread,

To weave our story, to choose where we're led.

But can we find a way to let them both thrive?

To keep love alive while our ambitions drive?


It's a journey we must take, with courage in our stride,

Balancing love and ambition, together we'll ride.

For love gives us purpose, ambition fuels our soul,

Can we find the balance, to make our lives whole?


What will you choose, when the world's in your hand?

Love's tender embrace or ambitions so grand?

In the depths of your heart, where your dreams take a stand,

What will you choose, love or ambition's demand?


In the end, my dear, the choice is your own,

To let your heart guide you, let your true self be shown.

For in love and ambition, we find who we are,

A journey worth taking, whether near or afar.
